title: My Goals as a developer
---
I started out as a person seeking to make an application to make online education more social. My goal was to make an online application that would allow students to collaborate with teachers and counselors in real time. The unique thing about my application would be to group students together according to their interests and their competencies. If the students had more questions during a class they would be able to break into smaller groups and those small groups could be combined together into a bigger group of students with similar questions from different classes. Grouping and regrouping students together would be what would make my application unique and would make online education have an advantage over traditional education.

I heard about Rails and how it was the fastest way to build a web application and how all the startups especially in Silicon Valley were using it. Being in Nepal at the time and wanting to make a good living from abroad I figured it was a good idea to take a course where I would be able to get the skills I need to get a good job and be able to build my own products I could use for a successful online business.

As I was learning about rails I realized there was a lot I didn't know about web development or the web in general. I invested lots of time learning html, css, javascript, coffeescript, haml, nosql databases, object oriented programming, and functional programming. There is still a lot I don't know but I have come a long ways since beginning my journey in web development.

One of the things that intrigues me the most is multi model databases such as arrango db and using functional languages such as elixir to build highly scalable and agile chat applications.

My goals are to learn more about how to integrate multi model databases, how to make web applications more agile and eventually how to make my own framework that can be used to develop both web and mobile applications.
