title: What I learned during my time at Bloc
---

When I joined bloc I had some experience programming in Ruby, C#, SQL, C, assembly, and Java. I hadn't worked with web frameworks much or done much on that command line. From my experience at bloc I became a lot better at programming in Ruby, learned HTML and CSS, and learned how Rails worked.

I first learned how to build a basic CRUD app with rails and then I learned a little bit of AJAX and how to integrate different gems into my application. Learning about Haml got me excited because it looked so much cleaner to me than Erb. I read a book called Object Oriented Design where I learned about the importance of encapsulating variables and making my classes and methods have only a single responsibility so they were easier to modify and refactor.

On the side I also learned more about Javascript and Coffescript through Codeacademy and some online tutorials. A major thing I learned is how to nest forms with multiple models and how to build forms from table joins. In my capstone I learned about how to build database schemas and seed my database with the faker gem.
