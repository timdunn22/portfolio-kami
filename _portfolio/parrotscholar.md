## Explanation

As I was teaching students English through Skype I noticed that the students didn't seem to have many choices of credible online institutions where to learn from. So I decided to make a platform myself that allowed students the maximum flexibility when it comes to their education.

## Problem
Most online education platforms are not very socially integrated and they don't allow the students to have group classes with other students. Those wanting to start a remote educational institution of their own have a difficult time finding the necessary resources to do so and the people to work with.


## Solution

I allow the students to form their own student groups allowing them to learn with those they would be comfortable with. Allow users to make an entrepreneur profile where they are able to publicize their desire to start an institute and what kind of institute they would like to start.

## Results

I learned through making this application how to build more complex forms and how to integrate more advanced schemas. Making forms using join tables was not known to me before but not it seems a less troubling. I learned how to make use tabs in bootstrap.

## Conclusion
The application is off to a good start. There are more features yet to develop but I have learned a lot especially about making database schema's that can work well with the application.
