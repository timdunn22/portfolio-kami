## Explanation

When life gets busy lists are made and it becomes hard to keep track of everything we need to do. In order to track things that we need to do I made Blocitoff.

## Problem
To do lists are difficult to track and we don't always know which things we have already done and those things we still need to do.


## Solution

Provide an application that will users to create their own to do lists and whenever they have completed the task delete it from the to do list after seven days.

## Results

Being one of my first rails applications on this project I learned how to do CRUD operations. I also got more familiar with learning devise and learned how to use haml instead of erb. I also got to get a bit more familiar with bootstrap.

## Conclusion

The application served it's purpose by allowing users to make a self destructing todo list even without a full page refresh. Using haml allowed me to write code that was easier to read and focus on the business logic of the application.
