## Explanation

Wikis allow people to share their ideas with the public or with close friends. People thus need to be able to decide who they want to share their wikis with and allow other users to edit their wikis if they so desire. Therefore I built an application that allows people to have public or private wikis depending on if they want the free or premium version.

## Problem
People want to be able to limit who can edit their wikis and who can see their wikis. They also may have some wikis they want everybody to be able to see.


## Solution
The user can sign up for a free or premium account. If they have a premium account they are able to have private wikis where only those they choose will be able to see them and edit them. Free accounts will provide the user with the ability to create wikis that are public but not wikis that can only be seen by a select few.


## Results
In this project I learned a lot about associations and nested forms. I learned how to use has many through relationships. I also learned how to use stripe as a payment gateway and how to configure devise.


## Conclusion

The project was successful as I was able to learn a lot about nested forms, how to use stripe, and how to integrate devise so that a user can upgrade to paid account.
